       This document describes the <em>lexicography module</em> of the Lexicon Model for Ontologies (<em>lemon</em>) as a result of the work of the Ontology Lexica community group (OntoLex). The module is targeted at the representation of dictionaries and any other linguistic resource containing lexicographic data, and addresses structures and annotations commonly found in lexicography. This module operates in combination with the <em>lemon</em> core module, referred to as <em>OntoLex</em>.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

	  <section>
	  <h3> Background and motivation </h3>
      <p> The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/"><em>lemon</em> model</a> provides a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/#core">core</a> vocabulary (OntoLex) to represent <em>linguistic information</em> related to ontology and vocabulary elements. The model follows the principle of <em>semantics by reference</em> in the sense that the semantics of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/#LexicalEntry">lexical entry</a> is expressed by reference to an individual, class or property defined in an ontology. </p>

	  <p> The current version of <em>lemon</em> (as an outcome of the OntoLex group, sometimes referred as OntoLex-<i>lemon</i> in the literature) as well as its previous version (<a href="https://lemon-model.net/">lemon</a> [<cite><a href="#bib-mccrae-lemon">1</a></cite>]) have been increasingly used in the context of work in dictionaries and lexicographical data to convert existent lexicographic information into the standards and formats of the Semantic Web. Such preliminary experiences comprise monolingual [<cite><a href="#bib-klimek-kdict">2</a></cite>], bilingual [<cite><a href="#bib-gracia-apertium">3</a></cite>], and multilingual [<cite><a href="#bib-bosque-kdict">4</a></cite>] dictionaries, as well as diachronic [<cite><a href="#bib-kahn-diachronic">5</a></cite>], dialectal [<cite><a href="#bib-declerck-dialectal">6</a></cite>], and etymological ones [<cite><a href="#bib-abromeit-etymological">7</a></cite>], among others.
	  The added value of using linked data technologies in lexicography and its implications for the micro and macro structure of dictionaries have been explored as well by several authors [e.g., <cite><a href="#bib-bosque-lexicography">8</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#bib-declerck-paneuropean">9</a></cite>]. </p>

<p> After analysing the literature, the proposers of this module perceived a strong need for reaching some agreement that allows for a better and more inter-operable migration of existing dictionaries into linked data [<cite><a href="#bib-bosque-module">10</a></cite>]. For illustration, the Oxford Global Language ontology [<cite><a href="#bib-parvizi-oxford">11</a></cite>] has its own notion of <i>dictionary entry</i>  materialised in the <tt>ogl:Entry</tt> class, while in [<cite><a href="#bib-bosque-kdict">4</a></cite>] the ad-hoc  <tt>kd:dictionaryEntry</tt> relation was introduced in the conversion of the multilingual Global Series of KDictionaries, i.e, different researchers introduced their own modelling solutions to account for similar notions. Interoperability is a key issue in linked data technologies, thus building a common space in which these concepts can be agreed upon and commonly defined is a logical next step. The OntoLex community is the natural forum to accomplish this for several reasons: </p>

 
	   <ol>
		<li> The extended use of <em>lemon</em> to convert language resources (including lexicographic resources) into linked data,
		<li> the nature of the <em>lemon</em> model being descriptive but not prescriptive, which facilitates neutrality towards different lexicographic views,
		<li> the coming together of the lexicography and the Semantic Web communities, and
		<li> the possibility of reusing already available mechanisms in <em>lemon</em>, preventing researchers from "re-inventing the wheel."
	   </ol>

	  </section>
	  <section>
	  <h3> Aim and scope </h3>

	  <p>
		The main goal of this module is to complement the <em>lemon</em> core module, OntoLex, and to overcome its limitations when modelling lexicographic information as linked data in a way that is <i>agnostic to the underlying lexicographic view</i> and minimises information loss.
	  </p>

	<p> The scope of the model is two-fold:
		<ol>
			<li> Modelling <em>existing</em> lexicographic resources as linked data, to allow their later publication and inter-operation by following Semantic Web standards, and
			<li> providing a conceptual / abstract model of language and linguistic objects in lexicography that will allow for building linked data-based lexicographic resources from scratch.
		</ol>

Modelling existing dictionaries as linked data can be done by first extracting the features they have in common and modelling them in a way that is decoupled from specific linguistic views. Although the primary goal might be to model existing resources, the module should remain highly re-usable across dictionaries and useful for new linked data-based lexicographic works developed from scratch (see the notion of <em>linked data-native dictionaries</em> at [<cite><a href="#bib-gracia-native">12</a></cite>]). Naturally, we assume that <em>many specific ingredients from specific dictionaries and views will still need ad-hoc constructs</em>. Still, having a small set of common entities defined in the module will help to overcome the limitations that have been detected in the experiences of instantiating <em>lemon</em> with lexicographic data, and can greatly promote interoperability.

	<div class="note"><p>
	In terms of applying the module, we propose the following best practice or "rule of thumb" when representing a dictionary as linked data:
		<ol>
			<li> As long as the entities in OntoLex and the other  <em>lemon</em> modules, together with those of catalogues of linguistic categories (e.g. LexInfo), suffice to represent the information encoded in the lexicographic resource (e.g., lexical entry, part of speech, translation, ...), the OntoLex lexicography module should not be instantiated.
			<li> In the case of lexicographic information that cannot be modelled by using either OntoLex nor any of the other <em>lemon</em> modules (e.g., to denote sense ordering), the model should be instantiated while avoiding duplicities and keeping extra information to the minimum.
		</ol>
	The reason behind this is that this module adds some complexity by providing additional description capabilities to the purely lexical description accounted by OntoLex. If this information is not needed for a specific conversion, i.e, if the lexicographic view is not essential, reusing <em>lemon</em> would allow for keeping the representation simpler but yet sufficient.

    <h2>Lexicography Module (<i>lexicog</i>)</h2>

	  The following diagram depicts the OntoLex lexicography module (<i>lexicog</i>). Boxes represent classes of the model. Arrows with filled heads represent object properties, while arrows with empty heads represent the <tt>rdfs:subClassOf</tt> relation. Note that the module provides elements to account for structures common in lexicographic resources (shaded in blue) as well as some to capture annotations and additional information describing lexical elements as found in dictionaries (shaded in orange).

	  <h3>Lexicographic Resource</h3>

    <p>The class <tt>lime:Lexicon</tt> has been used in the literature as a natural way of modelling a collection of dictionary entries. However, there are certain situations (see [<cite><a href="#bib-bosque-module">10</a></cite>]) in which there is no one-to-one mapping between the entries in a dictionary, or lexicographic resource in general, and the lexical entries in a <i>lemon</i> lexicon (<tt>lime:Lexicon</tt>).
    For instance, some dictionary entries contain information about their translations and synonyms, though the latter might not have their own dictionary entry in the source dictionary. Still, such translations and synonyms can be treated as "first class citizens" in the RDF graph by representing them as <i>lemon</i> lexical entries with <tt>ontolex:LexicalEntry</tt>. In such situations, there is a disparity between the ensuing <i>lemon</i> lexicon and the original dictionary, as the linked data representation would include entries not encoded in the original resource as dictionary entries.</p>

	<p>Thus, the class <a href="#LexicographicResource">Lexicographic Resource</a> is intended to represent the original resource, in order to keep track of the collection of lexicographic <a href="#Entry">entries</a> contained in it. This does not replace, but complements, the use of <tt>lime:Lexicon</tt>, which will include the lexical entries explicitly declared in the resource along with other ones (e.g., synonyms, translations)</p>

	  <h3>Entry</h3>

    <!-- we keep Entry, people would know they entry, the root of the lexicographic record, that's good for human readability -->

	<!-- Comento lo que sigue por simplicidad, podría ir a la seccion o documento de "giodelines/best practises". Yo creo que con el ejemplo de más abajo ya se entiende que puede cubrir estos casos

    <p>The lack of a one-to-one mapping from a dictionary entry to a <tt>ontolex:LexicalEntry</tt> referred above often translates into a situation in which a structure in the original resource needs to be split into several <tt>ontolex:LexicalEntr[ies]</tt> for the resulting resource to be OntoLex-compliant. For example, we find this scenario in dictionaries that do not make a dictionary entry split in terms of the part-of-speech of a word. In these resources, the senses of a (polysemous) word are bundled together under the same dictionary entry even though they depend on different parts-of-speech. In these cases, these may be given as annotations just before the sense, e.g. <i>(n.)</i>, especially in non-digitally born resources. We can find this configuration also in dictionary entries that take different parts of speech depending on its syntactic behavior (e.g. adjective and adverb) without meaning change. </p>

    <p>In addition to bundling together lexical entries with different parts of speech, an entry in a lexicographic resource can also be composed of other (sub-)structures arranged in a particular order or hierarchy, such as senses, nested entries, etc. </p>
-->
    <p>The class <a href="#Entry">Entry</a> is introduced to represent the entry as it is encoded in a lexicographic resource, e.g. a dictionary entry, thereby reflecting the arrangement decided upon by the lexicographer (supported by the occurrences of the word or phrase in the corpus used for dictionary compilation). This class is thus intended to be the counterpart of the lemon lexical entry (<tt>ontolex:LexicalEntry</tt>) in the linked data representation of a dictionary, and fulfills a structural function. <!-- Although there are no features differentiating an <a href="#Entry">Entry</a> from its parent class, <a href="#LexicographicComponent">Lexicographic Component</a>, the former is used as the root of the lexicographic record and its role as core of the resource facilitates human readability of the RDF representation of the entry structure. </p> -->

  <h3>entry</h3>

  The property <a href="#entry">entry</a> relates an instance of the class representing the <a href="#LexicographicResource">lexicographic resource</a> to the actual <a href="#Entry">entry</a> (or 'record' in the literature). This property is a counterpart of <tt>lime:entry</tt>, which relates <tt>lime:Lexicon</tt> to <tt>ontolex:LexicalEntry</tt>.

 <p>The property <strong>entry</strong> relates a lexicog:LexicographicResource to a lexicog:Entry.  </p>

 <div class="description">
 <p><strong>Domain</strong>: LexicographicResource</p>

 </div>

 
 
     <p>A simple example of an <a href="#Entry">entry</a> belonging to a <a href="#LexicographicResource">lexicographic resource</a> in English is given below. In this example, a lexicographic record for the word <i>animal</i> groups (under the same dictionary entry) descriptions for the lexical entries <i>animal</i> (n.), and <i>animal</i> (adj.), which both share phonetic representation and etymology. The example has been extracted from the American Heritage Dictionary [<cite><a href="#american-heritage-dict">16</a></cite>]:<p>


<blockquote id="ExampleAmericanHeritage" cite="https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=animal">
<strong>an·i·mal</strong>
 <p>n.
 <p>
1. Any of numerous multicellular eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Metazoa (or Animalia) [...]  </p>
<p>
2. An animal organism other than a human, especially a mammal.
</p>
[...]
<p>
<p>
adj.
<p>
1. Relating to, characteristic of, or derived from an animal or animals, especially when not human: animal cells; animal welfare.</p>
<p>
2. Relating to the physical as distinct from the rational or spiritual nature of people: animal instincts and desires.</p>
<p>
</blockquote>
 
 
  
  <p>In this example, a dictionary provides one single dictionary entry for the word <i>animal</i>, comprising its noun and adjective definitions under one same structure. This is not compliant with the definition of <tt>ontolex:LexicalEntry</tt>, which requires a single part of speech. Therefore, a <tt>lime:Lexicon</tt> accounting for the lexical information in this dictionary will contain two lexical entries, one per part of speech. On the other hand, an instance of the <a href="#LexicographicResource"> Lexicographic Resource </a> class will gather entities <i>as they were presented in the original dictionary</i> in order to keep track of the original representation. In this example, <i>animal</i> will be the only entry of the lexicographic resource:
  </p>

  <!--While in this example <tt>:person_n</tt> and <tt>:animal_n</tt> are lexical entries compliant to the <tt>ontolex:LexicalEntry</tt> definition, a dictionary may provide only one single dictionary entry for the word <i>good</i>, compressing its noun, adjective and (colloquial) adverb definitions under one same structure. While the generated <tt>lime:Lexicon</tt> will contain entries with one single part of speech, following the <i>lemon</i> model, the <tt>lexicog:LexicographicResource</tt> instance will gather entities <i>as they were presented in the original lexicographic resource</i> in order to keep track of the of original representation in its RDF version:</p> -->

    <h3>Lexicographic Component</h3>

	 <p>A <a href="#LexicographicComponent">lexicographic component</a> is a structural element in the <a href="#LexicographicResource">lexicographic resource</a> that represents either a lexicographic record or any other sub-structure to refer to senses, sense groups, or nested entries. Lexicographic components do not necessarily describe lexical data but can often fulfill a grouping function to gather other components that do. <a href="#Entry">Entry</a> is a particular subclass of <a href="#LexicographicComponent">Lexicographic Component</a> used to represent the main "entry point" in the dictionary, i.e., the headword or the root of the lexicographic record.
	 The <a href="#LexicographicComponent">lexicographic components</a> can describe lexical senses (<tt>ontolex:LexicalSense</tt>) or lexical entries (<tt>ontolex:LexicalEntry</tt>), depending on the arrangement in the original resource. Components can in turn be arranged in a specific order and/or hierarchy or just be declared to be part of an <a href="#Entry">entry</a>. </p>

     <!-- <p>Entry is intended to fulfill a structural function so as to serve as counterpart of a lexicographic record in a resource, which may or may not be straightly mapped into <tt>ontolex:LexicalEntries</tt>. However, these lexicographic records often contain sub-structures to refer to senses, sense groups, or nested entries. In an analogy to <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/csvw"> W3C's CSVW vocabulary </a>, where a <tt>csvw:Table</tt> consists of <tt>csvw:Row(s)</tt> and <tt>csvw:Column(s)</tt>,
	 We can state that there are structural components in a lexicographic resource, <tt>lexicog:LexicographicComponents</tt> that can describe <tt>ontolex:LexicalSenses</tt> or <tt>ontolex:LexicalEntries</tt>, depending on the arrangement in original resource. Components can in turn be arranged in a specific order and/or hierarchy, if desired, or just be declared to be part of a <tt>lexicog:Entry</tt>. Lexicographic components do not necessarily decribe lexical data but can often fulfill a grouping function to gather other compoments that do. This makes <tt>lexicog:LexicographicComponents</tt> semantically weak but structurally strong.<p> -->

	In our <a href="#ExampleAmericanHeritage">previous example</a> (animal) two different <tt>ontolex:LexicalEntries</tt> are grouped together in the same lexicographic record (<a href="#Entry">entry</a>). If we want to capture this in our RDF representation, we have to start by stating that the single entry has two lexicographic components.

    <h3>describes</h3>

    Since <tt>lexicog:LexicographicComponents</tt> fulfill a structural function to reflect the arrangment of the descriptions provided in a lexicographic resource (order, hierarchy, grouping, etc.), they do not encode lexical content themselves. This is usually accounted for by OntoLex elements, which are <i>described</i> by the components. This is grounded on the idea that a lexicographic resource describes the lexicon of a language (set of languages, dialect, field of study, etc.) following different criteria, e.g. the intended use of the resource, lexicographic tradition, etc. which can affect the description of the lexical content, leading to, for instance, two different resources describing the same lexicon differently. However, in theory, a component could describe any information provided in the resource, e.g. etymology, so the range of the property is not limited to current <i>lemon</i> elements.

    The property <tt>lexicog:describes</tt> allows us to link <tt>lexicog:LexicographicComponents</tt> to the Ontolex core elements that capture lexical data:

<div id="describes" class="entity">
<h3 id="describes-object-property">Describes (Object Property)<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#describes-object-property"></a></h3>
<div>
<p><strong>URI:</strong> <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/lexicog#describes" class="uri">http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/lexicog#describes</a></p>
</div>
<div class="comment">
<p>The property <strong>describes</strong> relates a lexicographic component to an element that represents the actual information provided by that component in the lexicographic resource. In most cases, this information will be lexical, and hence the object of the property will be an instance of ontolex:LexicalEntry or ontolex:LexicalSense. </p>

<div class="description">
<p><strong>Domain</strong>: LexicographicComponent</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong>: owl:Thing </p>

Following our example, we can use the <a href="#describes">describes</a> property to put in relation the two components belonging to the lexicographic resource with the lexical entries that they describe:

<!-- are grouped together in the same lexicographic record (<a href="#Entry">entry</a>), each with a sense ordering. If this exact lexicographic record were to be recreated with the <i>lexicog</i> vocabulary, we would have the following RDF triples, which extends our previous example by stating that the single entry has two lexicographic components, which in turn describe their corresponding lexical entries. In this example, we capture that the components belong to the entry by simply using the RDF native mechanisms for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containervocab">containers</a>, in particular the <tt>rdfs:member</tt> property:

In the dictionary entry, other dictionaries provide an ordered list of senses without any explicit sub-entry division per part-of-speech beyond an annotation at the sense level.

    <h3 id=subComponent>subComponent</h3>

There are cases in which lexicographic components are arranged in a particular hierarchy: a dictionary entry may include a list of senses (even with sub-senses) or sub-entries. <!--If the exact order in which these components are arragend is not to be reflected in the RDF representation, the <tt>lexicog:subComponent</tt> property serves to encode the hierarchical arrangement.-->
This can be expressed by means of the RDF native mechanisms for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_containervocab">containers</a>. In case that one wants to explicitly reflect that this is a hierarchical relation between lexicographic components, the <tt>lexicog:subComponent</tt> property can be used instead of, or in addition to, such RDF container mechanisms.

<section>
    <h3>FormRestriction</h3>

    There are numerous cases in which a lexicographic record specifies the grammatical features the lemma shows when used in some of its senses. For example, in English, the lemmas <i>good</i>, <i>manner</i>,  <i>air</i> or <i>wood</i> have senses which are usually (or only) attested when the word is used in plural, often indicated with the lemma in plural form, as the following entry from <i>Oxford English Living Dictionaries Online</i> [<cite><a href="#OED-dict-air">18</a></cite>], or with a usage note in the dictionary entry:


<blockquote cite="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/air">
<strong>air</strong>
 <p>n. [...]
 <p>
2. An impression of a quality or manner given by someone or something. [...]
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
   2.1 <strong>(airs)</strong> An annoyingly affected and condescending manner.
</p>
[...]

</blockquote>


<p>
    While there are plural nouns which only occur in plural form (e.g. <i>ammends</i>, <i>scissors</i>), the so-called <i>pluralia tantum</i>, and they are usually defined in their own dictionary entry, there is also some variance across lexicographic resources in cases in which the noun also occurs in singular form. For instance, see <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/glasses"> <i>glasses</i></a> in Oxford Living Dictionaries, in an entry separate from <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/glass"> <i>glass</i></a> [<cite><a href="#OED-dict-glasses">19</a></cite>], as opposed to its treatment as a sub-sense of a sense of the lemma <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/glass">
      <i>glass</i></a> in Merriam Webster Dictionary, with the annotation  "<i><strong>glasses</strong> plural</i>" [<cite><a href="#MWD-glass">20</a></cite>].

</p>

<p>
There are dictionaries which provide grammatical annotations indicating varying gender in the senses of the same dictionary entry. For example, in Spanish, the lemma <i>policía</i> can be used in feminine or masculine if denoting a police officer, but only in feminine when denoting the police force or administration. Depending on the criteria followed for headword selection during the compilation of the resource, e.g. etymology, in these cases we may find two independent entries or one single entry with senses having different gender restrictions.

</p>

The <tt>lexicog:FormRestriction</tt> class is intended to provide a way to specify, from an external catalogue of linguistic data categories, the set of grammatical features of a lexical entry when used in a specific <tt>ontolex:LexicalSense</tt> in cases in which it does not allow for all of those reflected in the lexical forms provided. For example, in Spanish, <i>ratón</i> 'mouse', in its meaning of "animal", has a masculine and a feminine form. In its meaning of computer device, small rock or biceps (in Costa Rica), it only occurs as masculine, and therefore these senses would receive a FormRestriction.

<!--[DRAFT: Julia: the word "restriction" here evokes a `reduction' of the number of features, but in some cases a sense may occur in feminine and masculine in a sense, and only in masculine in the rest of the list (e.g. Spanish: ratón, ratona (mouse, masc and fem.) Only masc. when referring to the device attached to the computer). Where does the restriction go?
Julia, replying to myself: I would say the restriction goes on those senses which are only attested with the masc. noun, the other senses (mouse as animal) would not have a restricton].->

  <h3>UsageExample</h3>

There are occasions in which lexicographic records also include an example of use of an entry in each of its senses. While these examples can be captured as <tt>skos:examples</tt> of <tt>ontolex:LexicalConcept</tt>, sometimes there is more information about the example beyond the text itself. 
The class <tt>lexicog:UsageExample</tt> is intentended to represent a textual example of the usage of a sense in a given lexicographic record. A usage example can group several string values, in which case they will encode the same meaning. Thus, if such values are expressed in different languages, they can be interpreted as translations. Usage examples can be linked to any other relevant information related to them, from provenance to usage notes:

  <h3>example</h3>

In those cases in which it is necessary to instantiate a <tt>lexicog:UsageExample</tt> because there is further information about an example beyond the text itself (otherwise, <tt>skos:example</tt> would suffice), the <tt>lexicog:example</tt> property allows us to link an <tt>ontolex:LexicalSense</tt> to a <tt>lexicog:UsageExample</tt> element.

For instance, a bilingual dictionary such as <a href="https://www.wordreference.com/es/translation.asp?tranword=monastery"> the English-Spanish WordReference Dictionary</a> [<cite><a href="#WR-monasterio">21</a></cite>] can include, for a sense, a usage example and a translation of the usage example in the target language:


<blockquote cite="https://www.wordreference.com/es/translation.asp?tranword=monastery">
 <p> <strong>monastery</strong> n (monk's residence) [English]  monasterio nm [Spanish]
 <p style="margin-left: 40px">
<i>We visited a Buddhist monastery deep in a jungle.</i>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
<i>Visitamos un monasterio budista en medio de la selva.</i>
</p>
<!--<p> <strong>monastery</strong> n (community of monks) [English]	congregación nf [Spanish]
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
<i>Most English monasteries were dissolved by King Henry VIII.</i>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
